<p> In this page I will go over the basic principal of HTML code. This site can be used to remind someone how to write basic code. I will start by writing how to set up the HTML document, and then I will talk about the coding used to contruct your HTML web page.</p>

<p> The first tags that you need to put in is < !DOCTYPE html >. This tag will deem this page of code as HTML. Under this line of code you need to put < html > and < body >. This tag says that you are about to start typing HTML and that the body of content is about to begin. </p>

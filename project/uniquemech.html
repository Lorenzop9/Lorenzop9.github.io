    <h2>Unique Weapons </h2>
    <p>This unique mechanics of this game largely lies in the weapon the characters yield. While many characters wield a normal looking gun, many carry something out of a Sci-Fi movie. These guns have different range and ammo loads that are not as intiative as a traditional gun and require skill and game experience to use correctly</p>

     <p>This weapons is Meiâ€™s freeze gun. It can shoot enemies with a long range icicle or spray with a short range freeze mist. The ideal combo is to use the mist to freeze the enemy or stop them from moving and then gunning them down with an icicle. However the mist requires you to be close and it takes strategy and hundreds of hours to combine these correctly </p>

     <p>This weapon is Reinhart's hammer. Reinhart is a tank and has a lot of health but the hammes is obviously a melee weapon and you need to stand next to your opponent to hit them. This means you need to use your big shield and your charge ability to get close to your enemy and whack them. This also take practice and confuses new players</p>

    <h2>The Transition from Conventional First Person Shooter</h2>
    <p>Overwatch is a first person shooter but it is very different than the traditional call of duty game. Most first person shooters involve you picking up a gun, as an animated human, and simulating actual gunfights. People die quickly and the guns look the ones the army uses today. Overwatch has characters who are animals, hold almost magical abilities, and fight in ways that are nothing like war. Coming from a game like CoD or Halo the skills are not as transferable as you would believe. This makes the pro Halo player pissed off when they first start playing because they have to start from the beginning. Below is a picture of a Call of Duty game on the left and a Overwatch character (Genji). For some reason shurikens and guns are very different when fighting an opponent. </p>

    <h2>Unique Movement</h2>
    <p>All of these characters also have very different movement speeds. In other first person shooters there are forms of futuristic movement. Double jumping, wall running, flying briefly, etc. This game is different because each character has different movement.</p>

     <p>Genji has increased speed walking and can double jump. Phara can fly for set periods of time. DVA (a tank) can also fly for a time much shorter than Phara. Hanzo (an archer) can climb walls. And most significantly Lucio (shown above) can actually ride on walls and speed boost. With every character having their own movement there are spots on each map that only a portion of characters can reach, or places that are difficult to reach for some and easy for others. This creates an interesting dynamic for newcomers who do not know how to navigate the tricky maps. All of these differences to the traditional FPS is why Overwatch players can become so toxic.</p>

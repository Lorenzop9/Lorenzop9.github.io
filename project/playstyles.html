    <h2>The “Cheese” Crew </h2>
    <p>These characters are the ones that have mechanics that are seen as “cheesy”. These are moves that make the character overpowered or just plain annoying. Most of these require very little skill to perform well. Making an entire team of these characters is called a cheese comp.</p>

    <p>This character is Mei and she uses a gun that sprays enemies with ice. It has a short distance but this gun quickly freezes you and prevents movement for 2 seconds. From there she can use her other ability to shoot you in the head with an icicle. This is extremely annoying because the freezing makes you an easy kill and helpless. People hate Mei.</p>
    
     <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lorenzop9/Lorenzop9.github.io/master/images/bastion-concept.jpg" width="250" height="250">
     <p>Bastion is a robot that can turn into a sentry gun. In sentry mode Bastion can not move but he becomes a gun with 400 ammo that can melt an enemy in less than a second. A well placed bastion can kill an entire team. This becomes even more annoying when the team uses shields to protect bastion and buff him.</p>

      <p>Torbjorn is a weapon smith that places a turret that can mow down enemies by itself. Torb put the turret down and leaves and now gets several kills with no effort.</p>

       <p>Symmetra also has turrets she can place that will kill enemies as you do something else. She also holds a gun that will lock onto enemies when firing, requiring no skill to take out an enemy.</p>

    <h2>Main Content</h2>
    <p>As I have said the game has 24 unique characters to choose from and there can only be one of each character in the roster on each team. This means over the course of 5 games you will most likely see most of the 24. We can see by the role system each character has many different attributes in health and damage depending on what role they intend to fill. With literally 24 unique weapons, 24 special abilities that generate at their own speeds, and over 40 unique abilities, there is so many different ways to kill your enemy. With this many choices there is bound to be characters and abilities that the community believes is unbalanced leading to toxicity. On this page are 8 of the 24 characters and some of the things that make them anger the community. Below is first person game play for three charcters metioned in this list</p>

    <h2>The Overpowered Characters</h2>
    <p> There is another group of characters that are just as annoying as the “Cheese” characters and they are called the “OP” characters. The catch is these characters only make people upset if your opponent is really good.</p>

    <p>This is actually two characters, Phara and Mercy. Phara can fly and shoot down rockets at her pray and Mercy is a healer that can fly to an enemy in the air. With constant healing it is tough to kill phara even as an excellent shot making people feel helpless to this combo.</p>
    
     <img src="https://d1u1mce87gyfbn.cloudfront.net/media/screenshot/widowmaker-screenshot-001.jpg" width="250" height="250">
     <p>Widowmaker is a sniper that shoots her pray dead in a single headshot. It is extremely difficult to time the perfect head shot but a really good widow can absolutely destroy an entire team in seconds</p>
     
      <img src="https://www.furiouspaul.com/overwatch/images/tracer/tracer.png" width="250" height="250">
      <p>Tracer has the lowest health in the game but can move the fastest. Her ability is to teleport 30 feet in a direction making her hard to kill. This also means she can zip behind enemy lines and annoy you the entire game.</p>
      
       <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KzU6xQFnpkw/maxresdefault.jpg" width="250" height="250">
       <p>Genji is a ninja who is 30 percent faster than all other characters. A tactical genji can take out any enemy and find there escape if they are losing. It is very hard to finish off a genji.</p>

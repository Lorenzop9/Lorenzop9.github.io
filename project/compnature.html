    <h2>How Hard is it to Climb The Ranks? </h2>
    <p>A typical game in Overwatch lasts between 10-20 minutes. In the competitive latter you must increase by 500 points to go up a rank. For example going 2100- 2600 will increase your rank from gold to platinum. On each win you will win somewhere between 15-35 points and a loss will tank you score 15-35 points. This variability will depend on your performance in the game. If you  do very well on the winning team you can win points in the 30 and if you are on the losing team you will lose less than 20 and inversely if you do poorly you will gain less and lose more. So to climb a rank you must win 20 more games than you lose and thats 5 hours of straight winning. So the answer is it is really hard. </p>

    <h2>What is The Competitive System in Overwatch? </h2>
    
    <p>The competitive system in Overwatch makes up the bulk of time played on the game. You can play other game modes that do not affect rating but most players will play competitive. You will get a rating 1-5000 sr or season rank. The system gives different rankings based on your sr shown below.</p>

    <p>The lowest most people get on this scale is around 600 and the highest is around 4700. The top 500 players in Grand Master will get the ranking of top 500 where they will actually compete for the number one spot of the highest sr. A season in Overwatch lasts 60 day and players have that long to get the highest score they can. When the season resets there is a 3 day off-season. When a season restarts you must complete 10 placement matches so the system can put you into the correct ran.</p>

    <h2>Why Does This Ranking System Make People so Angry?</h2>
    
    <p>As I have explained in the left hand column it is extremely hard climb up the ranks and you must devote a lot of time to increase to another rank. While all 12 players trying their best will only allow a 50% chance of winning (going lower or higher depending on the teamâ€™s skill level)  one player throwing the game can make that chance 0. 5 vs. 6 is unwinnable in most situations. This is why when one player makes a mistake people are quick to get angry. People play 50 plus hours a season to move up and when someone tries to send them back down they get angry.  Also the ranking system is so slow to reward you when your skills actually grow most people end up thinking they are rated way lower than they should be. This makes most competitive player grouchy and toxic. </p>

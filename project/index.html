    <h2>What is Overwatch?</h2>
    <div class="parabackground">
    <p>Overwatch is a fast paced first person shooter game available on PC and Console. The team is composed of 6 people versus another team of 6 and you must complete an objective based task quicker than your team. This consists of pushing a cart a certain distance, controlling a point, attacking a point while the other defend, or even a combination of these in hybrid game modes. Based on the game mode you will be placed on map with that game type and attempt to kill as many enemy team mates as possible while not dying and achieving your own objective.</p>

There are 24 characters, each with their own weapons and abilities. You can only have one of each character on a team and you must create a team that meshes well together. In this site each page will talk about different aspects of the game and I encourage you to read all of these while noticing my expertise in HTML and CSS</p>

    <h2>What is Toxicity? </h2>
    <p class="parabackground">Toxicity is state of mind present in a lot of video games. When you are playing any video game that excites you, you should feel some anger when losing to make winning that much more exciting. You can hear teens use words like "salty" to express people who get angry after losing a video game, and this salt has to be present to actually enjoy winning. Toxicity is different than salt because being toxic is being so upset you negatively affect your teammates. Overwatch being a cooperative game, you must work together with your teammates to win and bad teammates= a loss. An example of a bad teammate is someone who yells at their team, gives bad advice, and doesn’t work well with others. The toxicity epidemic is the wave of toxic behavior that one transfers to another until everyone who plays this game will treat you poorly. In this site I’m going to talk about why Overwatch has so many negative players. </p>

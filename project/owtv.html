    <h2>Toxic Twitch Streamers</h2>
    <p>Many Overwatch players enjoy watching professionals play the game. Esport tournaments are spread out and infrequent so many people turn to Twitch. Twitch is a streaming platform where you can watch others play games live and Overwatch has a big following on Twitch. You can look at how many people are watching Overwatch streams right now by clicking this <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Overwatch"> link</a>. The issue is that some of the most popular streamers are bad role models. While there a lot of different kinds of streamers, many yell at their teammates when losing and transfer blame away from themselves. This teaches impressionable younger players that is how they should treat people in the game. This mentality is what breads toxicity at all levels.</p>

    <h2> The Huge Esports Scene</h2>
    <p>Esports is an industry that is actually blowing up. Nerd want to watch their hobby be played on a professional level bringing hundreds of thousands to tune in on big tournaments. Here is a <a href="https://www.esportsearnings.com/"> link going over the history of Esports earnings </a>. Overwatch is a relatively new game coming out only a year and a half ago so this game was structured to have a huge esport scene. For game franchises, having a good pro circuit is vitale for making your game exciting. Overwatch has done a great job of establishing a following shown by this picture below of a tournament just a month ago. </p>

    <p>The league that Overwatch uses is called Overwatch league and it has teams representing different cities just like real league sports. I personally enjoy following the pro scene just as someone who has a life would follow the basketball pro scene</p>

    <h2>Can You Learn From Pro Players in Overwatch?</h2>
    <p>The short answer to this question is no you can not. Pro players are the equivalent of pro basketball players in that their skill is on another planet. The mechanical movement skills and aiming is one that take decades to perfect and there reaction time is superhuman. The only way to improve these skills is by playing not by watching.</p>
     <img src="https://fenixbazaar.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/owwc2.jpg" width="250" height="250">
     <p>Another reason you can’t replicate the strategies of a pro team with that of your team of strangers is the idea of communication. The level of communication dependent to play this game well is insane and pro teams practice 6 hours a day at least together to develop that level of expertise with each other. Often people will try to organize team compositions and strategies like the pros and when people inevitably don’t listen or perform their task wrong people get angry. These task masters will become very toxic when they don’t play the way the US National team plays. This is yet another way that the pros contribute indirectly to toxicity.</p>

  <p>Overall in this page I have extensively examined why people in the game I enjoy so much are always angry. I hope this page served as a valuable resource to learn what overwatch was and why this game has changed the way first person shooters are played. I hope I receive an excellent grade because I worked so hard on this content and on the coding. Thank you!</p>
